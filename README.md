# Analyzing Kickstarter Data for Plays


### Overview
This project was to pull data from kickstarter with regard to plays: successful and failed campaigns. We looked at a few key elements, including the time of year when the campaign was launched and the target goal investments.

### Challenges
The main challenge for this was isolating the important data from the unimportant. Once that was established, the next challenge was to sort and filter the most pertinent information for our targets.


### Conclusions
The most obvious conclusion from the campaign launch data is that May was categorically the best month to launch a kickstarter campaign for a play. Another obvious conclusion is that the fall and winter months are not a good time to launch a campaign.
The outcomes graph shows that the most successful campaigns were the ones with the lowest goals. 
The dataset we used had a lot of additional information that could be utilized to show even more key details, such as length of campaigns, average amount of money donated, and country of origin.
